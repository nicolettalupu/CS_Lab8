# email_confirmation
App  for sending confirmation email after user registration

I used Django for database.


## Implementation
To run the app install virtualenv

> sudo pip install virtualenv

Now, create a virtual environment within the project directory by typing

> virtualenv newenv

To install packages into the isolated environment, you must activate it by typing:

>source newenv/bin/activate

now install django here with

>pip install django

Database migration

>python3 manage.py migrate 

Run 
>python3 manage.py runserver
